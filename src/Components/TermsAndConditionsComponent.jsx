                <h2><strong>Secure protocol</strong></h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Our website uses the secure protocol HTTPS. The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, 
                    and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, 
                    and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and 
                    tampering. The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2><strong>Failures, alerts and security breaks</strong></h2>
